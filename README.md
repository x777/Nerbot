After your NFT will be sold, Nerbot will transfer the payment amount minus the marketplace fee minus a small network fee (for example, the price was 200 $CKB, you'll receive ~180 $CKB).
 
Seller mode allows you to manage your NFT transferred to the marketplace - view and withdraws from the marketplace.
 
### Buyer mode
Buyer mode allows you to buy any NFT at the marketplace. No fee, except a small network fee.
